hidden objects are hidden by changing its color to black which is the same color to the background
by having the same color of the background, it creates the effect of not being visible
but if the hidden objects is placed on the tiles, which is not black, 
then the hidden objects is now visible because its not real invisible but just colored black,
which can be seen if the tiles is colored white or gray.

if the player can only moved on the path tiles, then how big is the path and how big is the obstacles, items,
and the player?





objects being detected by the ripple effect sometimes dont turn to invisible again
--the script used to turn the objects detected is the ripple script and the ripple object is destroyed before
the detected objects are destroy, which basically destroy the script which stop it from turning invisible again
